# FpgaHelloWorld
A working project based on the [Ferris Make Hardware](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-sXmdrqqYYfGDt62AkTCF9opF4uLFieq) series. 

An introduction to working with FPGA and maybe C#.
 - [x] Get WSL 2 and Ubuntu setup under windows.
 - [x] Compile [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator) source code.
 - [x] Find/Write an example HDL circuit in Verilog.
 - [x] Compile the circuit using  [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator)
 - [x] Build a C++ simulation and exercises it.
 - [x] Frankenstien a MAKE file for single command, build, links, simulate.
 - [ ] C# code as a simulation driver.
 - [ ] Continue following tutorial from Ferris.

Currently requires [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator)
 - Verilator 4.037 devel rev v4.036-60-gfa828ac9
 - Must support verilator `--build` switch.
